{"name":"Vlc","tagline":"VLC media player","body":"###Contribution\r\nI have worked on adding standard closed captioning [CEA 708](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEA-708) features to VLC in addition to existing EIA 608 features. \r\n\r\n#### Appearance\r\nThe additional structures are added for new features added\r\n*eia708_PenAttribs_Size* -  3 text sizes\r\n\r\n*eia708_PenAttribs_FontTag* - 8 font options\r\n\r\n*eia708_PenColor* - 64 text colors, and 64 background colors\r\n\r\n*eia708_PenColor_Opacity* - background opacity and dropshadowed or edged text\r\nand other visual features\r\n\r\n#### Language\r\n708 captions have a complete library of special characters and symbols and are designed to support any alphabet in the world \r\n\r\n#### Position\r\n708 captions do not have to be fixed in one position. The window position can be adjusted accordingly which makes the user easy to change it according to the video which is being watched.\r\n*eia708_WindowAttribs,eia708_WindowAttribs_AnchorID,eia708_WindowAttribs_Justify* are the new structures defined to define the position.\r\n\r\nThe above structures are defined with the knowledge from the wikipedia page and some other sources. \r\nSome of basic set functions are also defined. pen color,pen attributes,pen location are all set to default. The reset function is also added.\r\n\r\nThe main structure **eia708_t** which is defined which consists of n windows.The present window has the features of pen,position and data.\r\n \r\n## Compiling VLC - Basics\r\nThe basics of compiling VLC in debian/ubuntu are already given in the [VLC Compile](https://wiki.videolan.org/UnixCompile/)\r\nThe below mentioned are some of the problems i've faced and solutions to them.I've also put some basics of software programming. \r\n\r\nI have put all the basic dependancies required.\r\nPlease go through [how to setup github](http://greeshmab.github.io/gitHelp/)\r\n\r\n###Environment:\r\nVLC requires a C99 compiler, development headers and a toolchain. \r\nIf you build from the Git repositories, you will also need the GNU build system, a.k.a. the \"autotools\" (autoconf, automake, libtool and gettext) to setup the Makefiles. Make sure they are up-to-date and usable for your system. \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo apt-get install git libtool build-essential pkg-config autoconf\r\n```\r\n###Get the source :\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git://git.videolan.org/vlc.git\r\n$ cd vlc\r\n$ ./bootstrap\r\n```\r\n\"Bootstrapping\" is used as a term for building a system using itself -- or more correctly, a predecessor version. In computing, a bootstrap loader is the first piece of code that runs when a machine starts, and is responsible for loading the rest of the operating system. In modern computers it's stored in ROM.\r\n\r\n###Libraries and dependencies:\r\n```\r\n$ sudo apt-get install libjack-jackd2-dev\r\n```\r\n###The \"Contrib\" method :\r\n```\r\nchecking for pcsclite... no\r\nconfigure: error: No package 'libpcsclite' found.\r\nmake: *** [.aribb25] Error 1\r\n```\r\nIf you are installing from source, you also need the \"-dev\" packages of the libs your source depends on. Try looking for a package called pcsc-lite-dev or pcsc-lite-libs-dev.\r\n```\r\n$sudo apt-get install libpcsclite-dev\r\n$ sudo apt-get build-dep vlc\r\n```\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
